Place your downloaded Three.js files in this directory:

1. three.min.js - The main Three.js library
2. OrbitControls.js - The controls extension

If these files are present here, the application will use them instead of trying to load from CDNs.
This can be useful if you're working offline or if your network blocks CDN requests.

You can download these files from:
- https://cdnjs.cloudflare.com/ajax/libs/three.js/r132/three.min.js
- https://threejs.org/examples/js/controls/OrbitControls.js

Or use the download buttons on the error page when Three.js fails to load.
